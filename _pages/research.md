### Reinforcement Learning

* `<b>`Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning `</b>` models the interaction of multiple agents as a stochastic game. We proposed communication-based methods to coordinate the behaviors of decentralized agents.

* `<b>`Offline Reinforcement Learning `</b>` aims to close the gap between real world environment and simulation environment. We are implementing algorithms on real autonomous vehicles for navigation, sensing, etc.

### Social Computing

* `<b>`Information Diffusion Prediction `</b>` is to predict the information cascade with historical data. We adopted cascade structure as the main feature for prediction.

### AI4Science

* `<b>`Single cell ATAC clustering `</b>` is to cluster the single cell ATAC data, which is high-dimension, sparse with lots of dropouts. We employ AI methods to analyze the cells.
* `<b>`Molecule structure prediction `</b>` and mining. We use deep (reinforcement) learning to predict the molecule structures.
